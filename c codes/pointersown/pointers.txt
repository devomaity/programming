Each and every bite in the memory storage has an address
#include<stdio.h>
int main()
{
    int a = 10;
    int *p
    p = &a;
    printf("%d",p); -> this prints the address p points to.
    printf("%d",*p); -> this prints the value stored in the address p.

    *p = 12; -> this is called dereferncing, it means we can change the value at 
    address p.
    
    // pointer arithmetic
    suppose the address stored in p is 2002
    printf("%d\n",p+1); --> Then in pointer arithmetic p+1 will be 2006
    As we know that a pointer stores the address of other varibles, then in pointer 
    arithmetic p+1 = it will increase the address by the sizeof the datatype of which 
    the pointer is declared.
