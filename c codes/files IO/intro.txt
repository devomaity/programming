Opening a file - creating or editing a file 

1) stdio.h contains a function called fopen()for opening files in c. 
2)The syntax for opening a file in standard I/O is:
       
        ptr = ("fileopen","mode")
3)  For example:
    
    fopen("E:\\devopriyo\\maity.txt","w");
    fopen("E:\\programming"\\bhai.bin","rb");

 Closing a file

1) Any file which is opened in a c program needs to be closed  
2) Closing  a file is accomplished by the library function fclose()
3) fclose(fptr); //fptr is the file pointer associated with file to be closed   

Reading a file  

1) In order to read a file, we can use fscanf funtion.
   
   syntax - fscanf(pointer name,"%s",string name);

2) This function is file version of scanf function
3) fscanf expects a file pointer in addition to the other arguments which scanf expects 
4) We will have to open the file in read mode in order to use this function 

Writing to a file 

1) In order to write a file, we can use fprintf funtion.
   
   syntax - fprintf(pointer name,"%s",string name);

2) This function is file version of printf function
3) fprintf expects a file pointer in addition to the other arguments which printf expects 
4) We will have to open the file in write mode in order to use this function
