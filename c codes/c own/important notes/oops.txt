oops - classes and objects 

c++
class --> extension of structures (in c)
structures had limitations
          - members are public 
          - no methods 
classes --> structures + more
classes --> can have methods and properties           
classes --> can make few members as private & few as public
structures in c++ are typdefed


In a class if the data members are decalared randomly the without using public or private, by default the members are private cause we can use or access those members inside the class 

if we want to create a object of array
syntax:

student arr[4]; --> array of object
for(int i=0;i<3;i++)
{
    cin>>arr[i];
}
