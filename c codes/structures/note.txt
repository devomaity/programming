Structure is a collection of one or more variables of different datatypes that are grouped together under a single name.


1) Structures are user defined datatypes in c.
2) Using Structures allows us to combine data of different types together 
3) It is used to create data types which contains diverse infotmation
4) That are very similar to arrays but structure cna store data of any type, which is practically more useful
5) Structures members are accessed Using dot(.)operator
6) (.) is called as "structure member operator"
Example - e1.id
         e1 - is structure name 
         id - member of structure


Syntax
======
struct [structure_name]
{
    data_type var 1
    data_type var 2
    data_type var 3
}
[structure_variables];

when we create a structure we are creating a whole different datatype and obviously we need a variable to access a datatype. 

Note - variables or members inside a structure cannot be initilized.
 structure variable - sizeof each structure variable is equal to the size of each member inside the structure
