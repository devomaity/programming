/*
call by value - 
(1) when we call a function by value, it means that we are passing the values of 
the arguments which are copied into the formal parameter of the function.

(2) which means that the original values remain unchanged and only the parameters inside the function changes.

void add(int a, int b) // here a and b are local variables.
int main()
{
    x=2,y=3;
    add(x,y) // here x and y are arguments. 
}
here assigned value of local variable(int a, int b) are those copied values of the arguments(x,y) which are declared in add(x,y) or user defined function when it is called.
